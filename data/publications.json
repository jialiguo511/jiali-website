    "shortSummary": "Our study utilized electronic health records (EHR) of an HIV outpatient clinic to assess the continuum of diabetes care among people with HIV (PWH) and explored potential disparities in the management of diabetes across different racial and sexual orientation groups. We observed higher crude prevalence among Black heterosexual men but no meaningful differences after adjusting for BMI.",

    "longSummary": [
      "People with HIV experience a disproportionate burden of diabetes and face greater difficulties in managing the condition effectively. Although race and sexual orientation are independent risk factors for HIV and cardiometabolic diseases, their impact on diabetes care among PWH remains understudied.",
      "In this retrospective study, we used EHR data from an HIV outpatient clinic to assess prevalence, monitoring, treatment, and control of diabetes across race and sexual orientation groups. While Black heterosexual men showed higher raw prevalence, adjustments for age and BMI eliminated those differences. Monitoring (HbA1c checks) was high overall, but few patients achieved adequate glycemic control, with no significant disparities."

    "shortSummary": "Using data from the two largest studies on youth-onset type 2 diabetes, our study identified three data-driven subtypes with distinct clinical characteristics. These subtypes highlight the heterogeneity of youth-onset type 2 diabetes, offering opportunities for improved risk stratification and tailored disease management.",

    "longSummary": [
      "Clinical presentations of individuals with youth-onset type 2 diabetes (T2D) display substantial heterogeneity, which data-driven clustering may help in categorizing. This study aims to identify subtypes of newly diagnosed youth-onset T2D using cluster analysis.",
      "We conducted a cross-sectional study including T2D patients (duration ≤1 year) aged 10-19 years from the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Study (n=304; 47.4%) and aged 10-17 years from the Treatment Options for Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth (n=337; 52.6%) study before intervention allocation. We examined variables available in routine clinical practice: body mass index (BMI), HbA1c, fasting C-peptide, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, LDL and HDL cholesterol. Main outcomes were data-driven subtypes identified using k-means clustering.",
      "Our analysis revealed three youth-onset subtypes: 48.5% had obesity-related T2D (yOD), 18.7% had insulin deficient T2D (yIDD), and 32.7% had insulin resistant T2D (yIRD). The yOD subtype were characterized by high BMI (33.5 kg/m² [SD: 3.7]) and low HbA1c (5.7%, IQR: 5.4–6.2%). The yIDD exhibited low fasting C-peptide levels (2.1 ng/mL [SD: 1.1]), high HDL cholesterol (48.2 mg/dL [SD: 9.6]), and high HbA1c (7.6%, IQR: 6.3–8.9%). The yIRD subtype had high BMI (38.8 kg/m² [SD: 7.3]), high fasting C-peptide (5.1 ng/mL [SD: 1.8]), and high blood pressures (SBP: 124.0 mmHg [SD: 9.4]; DBP: 76.2 mmHg [SD: 9.1]) compared to other subtypes.",
      "This analysis identified three subtypes of youth-onset T2D with different clinical characteristics. Management of youth-onset T2D may require tailored strategies by subtype."

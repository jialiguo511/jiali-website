    "shortSummary": "Our study utilized electronic health records (EHR) of an HIV outpatient clinic to assess the continuum of diabetes care among people with HIV (PWH) and explored potential disparities in the management of diabetes across different racial and sexual orientation groups.

    "longSummary": [
      "People with HIV experience a disproportionate burden of diabetes and face greater difficulties in managing the condition effectively. Although race and sexual orientation are independent risk factors for HIV and cardiometabolic diseases, their impact on diabetes care among PWH remains understudied.",
      "In this retrospective study, we used EHR data from an HIV outpatient clinic to assess prevalence, monitoring, treatment, and control of diabetes across race and sexual orientation groups. While Black heterosexual men showed higher raw prevalence, adjustments for age and BMI eliminated those differences. Monitoring (HbA1c checks) was high overall, but few patients achieved adequate glycemic control, with no significant disparities."

The yOD subtype were characterized by high BMI (33.5 kg/m² [SD: 3.7]) and low HbA1c (5.7%, IQR: 5.4–6.2%).

      "Understanding early changes before type 2 diabetes (T2D) diagnosis may improve subtype-specific prevention. We conducted a retrospective longitudinal study using four U.S. cohorts (CARDIA, DPP/DPPOS, JHS, MESA) to evaluate associations between seven pathophysiological markers and data-driven T2D subtypes. We analyzed 15-year trajectories among individuals with newly diagnosed T2D (≤1 year duration). Metabolic profiles showed distinct, non-linear patterns across subtypes. HbA1c increased sharply and HOMA2-%B declined in the five years before diagnosis for SIDD. HOMA2-IR rose for both SIRD and SIDD. SBP, HbA1c, and HOMA2-IR were robust prognostic markers across all subtypes. Higher BMI predicted MOD, SIRD, and SIDD but was inversely associated with MARD. These results highlight the importance of tracking biomarker trajectories in the pre-diagnostic period to improve early identification of subtype-specific risk and inform tailored interventions."

In a retrospective analysis of NHANES 2011–2018 participants (aged ≥18) classified as no diabetes (NoDM), pre-diabetes (PreDM), or diabetes (DM), researchers compared mean and distribution of %BF, BMI, and other cardiometabolic markers by sex and race/ethnicity. They found that although BMI and central‐adiposity measures rose progressively from NoDM to PreDM to DM, %BF was significantly higher only in PreDM versus NoDM (and, among men, higher in PreDM than in DM), while women exhibited consistently greater %BF across all dysglycemia stages and racial/ethnic subgroups. These data suggest that relying solely on %BF may be insufficient—especially in females—and should be complemented by other measures.",

We compared the means and distributions of %BF, BMI and cardiometabolic parameters, stratified by sex and race/ethnicity, for people with NoDM, Pre-Diabetes and DM.",
      "Our findings showed increasing levels of BMI and central adiposity anthropometric measures across the continuum of dysglycemia in the U.S. However, percentage of total body fat was only significantly higher in people with PreDM compared to people with noDM, and only significantly different in Males with PreDM compared to those with more advanced dysglycemic status of DM. We also demonstrated higher levels of body fat in females across the continuum of dysglycemia and also among different racial/ethnic subgroups. Our results demonstrated that percentage body fat should not be the only method of direct fat evaluation, particularly in females."

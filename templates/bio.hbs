I am driven by the question of how machine learning and artificial intelligence can unlock the full potential of cohort and electronic health record (EHR) data to transform clinical decision-making. My research focuses on modeling patient heterogeneity and disease trajectories to enable precision medicine strategies that deliver individualized, effective care. Through my work analyzing large-scale EHR and cohort datasets, I apply machine learning methods to uncover actionable patterns that support patient-centered interventions and advance the integration of real-world data into clinical practice.

While healthcare generates a wealth of data, critical gaps remain in how these resources are leveraged to improve patient outcomes. Electronic health records (EHR), though increasingly widespread, are still underutilized for predictive modeling, and claims data, while comprehensive in coverage, often lack key clinical details such as laboratory measurements. Each data source has limitations when used in isolation, but by integrating EHR, claims, genomic, and other datasets, we can better detect risk factors, monitor disease progression, and guide timely interventions. A major challenge lies in applying advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence methods to translate complex, heterogeneous data into clinically meaningful insights. My work focuses on applying and adapting informatics approaches to support precision medicine, with the goal of helping healthcare providers deliver more individualized, data-driven care in real-world clinical settings.

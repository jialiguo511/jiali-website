  <h5 class="serif mb-3">After all these years, she is professionally interested in:</h5>
  <p>
    I am driven by the question of how machine learning and artificial intelligence can unlock the full potential of
    cohort and electronic health record (EHR) data to transform clinical decision-making. My research focuses on
    modeling
    patient heterogeneity and disease trajectories to enable precision medicine strategies that deliver individualized,
    effective care. Through my work analyzing large-scale EHR and cohort datasets, I apply machine learning methods to
    uncover actionable patterns that support patient-centered interventions and advance the integration of real-world
    data
    into clinical practice.

    While healthcare generates a wealth of data, critical gaps remain in how these resources are leveraged to improve
    patient outcomes. Electronic health records (EHR), though increasingly widespread, are still underutilized for
    predictive modeling, and claims data, while comprehensive in coverage, often lack key clinical details such as
    laboratory measurements. Each data source has limitations when used in isolation, but by integrating EHR, claims,
    genomic, and other datasets, we can better detect risk factors, monitor disease progression, and guide timely
    interventions. A major challenge lies in applying advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence methods to
    translate complex, heterogeneous data into clinically meaningful insights. My current work focuses on applying and adapting
    informatics approaches to support precision medicine, with the goal of helping healthcare providers deliver more
    individualized, data-driven care in real-world clinical settings.

  <p>
    In the years to come, I hope to deepen my work at the intersection of data, medicine, and humanity. My mission is to
    develop tools that not only analyze health outcomes, but also honor the lives behind the numbers. Through research,
    collaboration, and quiet persistence, I aim to help shape a future where healthcare is more precise, more equitable,
    and more deeply connected to the real world we live in.

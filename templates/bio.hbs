  <h5>Biography</h5>

  <p>
    Jiali Guo is a data-crunching, cake-baking, dumpling-mastering powerhouse who bench-presses more than your average spreadsheet. By day, she’s the go-to biostatistician at Emory’s Global Diabetes Research Center, corralling terabytes of biomedical data into obedient R scripts and churning out publications faster than a bread-making mixer. By night, she transforms into the reigning queen of the countertop, whipping up Chinese delicacies that could make your taste buds do the Cha-Cha. On weekends you’ll find her at the CDC archives, nostalgically calculating hospital costs for TB like it’s a vintage wine review, all while maintaining her 99% data integrity with Excel and Tableau as her sous-chefs.

  When she’s not single-handedly mentoring PhD students through code potholes, or debating Bayesian semiparametric models in coffee shops, Jiali is in the gym, turning protein shakes into bulging biceps and reminding dumbbells who’s boss. With an MPH in Biostatistics (REAL Award!) and a PharmD-equivalent undergrad from China Pharmaceutical University, she’s equally comfortable discussing ANCOVA or the perfect balance of sugar and butter in a croissant. Jiali Guo: part statistician, part culinary wizard, part superhero—saving public health one algorithm, one dumpling, and one deadlift at a time. Her publication list is as impressive as her squat PR.

  <h5>Research Interests</h5>
  <p>
  I am driven by the question of how machine learning and artificial intelligence can unlock the full potential of cohort and electronic health record (EHR) data to transform clinical decision-making. My research focuses on modeling patient heterogeneity and disease trajectories to enable precision medicine strategies that deliver individualized, effective care. Through my work analyzing large-scale EHR and cohort datasets, I apply machine learning methods to uncover actionable patterns that support patient-centered interventions and advance the integration of real-world data into clinical practice.

  While healthcare generates a wealth of data, critical gaps remain in how these resources are leveraged to improve patient outcomes. Electronic health records (EHR), though increasingly widespread, are still underutilized for predictive modeling, and claims data, while comprehensive in coverage, often lack key clinical details such as laboratory measurements. Each data source has limitations when used in isolation, but by integrating EHR, claims, genomic, and other datasets, we can better detect risk factors, monitor disease progression, and guide timely interventions. A major challenge lies in applying advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence methods to translate complex, heterogeneous data into clinically meaningful insights. My work focuses on applying and adapting informatics approaches to support precision medicine, with the goal of helping healthcare providers deliver more individualized, data-driven care in real-world clinical settings.

          Hello, I am Jiali.
        </h1>
        <p class="hero-subtitle mb-4">
          A quiet thinker with a deep respect for nature, I approach both life and science with curiosity, care, and purpose. With a background in pharmacy and biostatistics, I now work as a biostatistician at the Emory Global Diabetes Research Center. My research lies at the intersection of chronic disease epidemiology, biomedical informatics, and health equity — with a special focus on diabetes and metabolic disorders.
        </p>  
        <p class="hero-subtitle mb-4">
          I’m drawn to patterns that live beneath the surface, to questions that challenge assumptions, and to the possibility that data — when used thoughtfully — can lead to more just, precise, and human-centered healthcare.
        </p>
        <p class="hero-subtitle mb-4">
          My mission is simple and steady: to make sense of complexity, to illuminate disparities, and to contribute to a science that respects both numbers and lives.

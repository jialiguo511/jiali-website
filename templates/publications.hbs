      Our study utilized electronic health records (EHR) of an HIV outpatient clinic to assess the continuum
      of diabetes care among people with HIV (PWH) and explored potential disparities in the management of diabetes
      across different racial and sexual orientation groups. We observed higher crude prevalence among Black
      heterosexual men but no meaningful differences after adjusting for BMI.

        People with HIV experience a disproportionate burden of diabetes and face greater difficulties in managing
        the condition effectively. Although race and sexual orientation are independent risk factors for HIV and
        cardiometabolic diseases, their impact on diabetes care among PWH remains understudied.
      </p>

        In this retrospective study, we used EHR data from an HIV outpatient clinic to assess prevalence, monitoring,
        treatment, and control of diabetes across race and sexual orientation groups. While Black heterosexual men
        showed higher raw prevalence, adjustments for age and BMI eliminated those differences. Monitoring (HbA1c checks)
        was high overall, but few patients achieved adequate glycemic control, with no significant disparities.
